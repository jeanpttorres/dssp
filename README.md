## Introduction
This repository stores general information about the **dataset** we have artificially generated for the Distinguishing String Selection Problem (DSSP) and the Distinguishing Substring Selection Problem (DSSSP). 

We are publishing here the **input files** for the instances, the **solutions** we have found, and **reports** comparing them through worksheets.

 
## Problems

 - Distinguishing String Selection Problem (DSSP)
 - Distinguishing Substrin Selection Problem (DSSSP)

## Algorithms

 - **exact**: a 30 minutes execution of the branch-and-bound algorithm applying the mathematical model described in [1];
 - **ra**: the **rounding algorithm** proposed in [2];
 - **bcpa**: an adaptation from the **basic core problem algorithm** also proposed in [2];
 - **bcpa0**: an execution of the bcpa described above which does not apply either predefined  heuristics or steps from the solver or SCIP;
 - **blpl**: a VNS implementation which applies the Mathematical Model in order to define its Neighbourhood Structure;
 - **sbpl**: a VNS based matheuristic which expands the blpl by applying the Mathematical Model in the Shaking and Local Search steps.

## Dataset
Let ***n*** be the size of the set ***Sc*** of Strings and ***m*** be the length of every string in  ***Sc***, the following datasets are available:

 - g1: *m* >> *n*
 - g2: *m* > *n*
 - g3: *n* > *m*

## Solutions
The target string we found applying every algorithm in each string from those sets above are reported in the **solutions** folder.

## Results
The values and results we found applying every algorithm in each string from those sets above are reported in the **results** folder.

## Reports
The folder **reports** contains worksheets with data comparison between the execution of those algorithms
